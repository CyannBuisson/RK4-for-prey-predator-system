During a project in my studies, I programmed the prey-predator system with the Lotka-Voltera and Rosenzweig-McArthur models.

I used for that the Runge-Kutta 4 method of resolution.

I share here the code, with the Lotka-Voltera system as an example, but you may use the code for any differential equation system (1 or 2 order, n equations of n variables).

The modifications to make for using it are explained in the code.

I hope this will be useful.
